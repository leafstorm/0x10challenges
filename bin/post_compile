# This is a Heroku post-compile hook.
# I'd prefer for this to live in the heroku/ directory, but the buildpack
# is hard-coded to look for it here.

# This works around the fact that dcpucore is currently under active
# development, by forcing pip to reinstall it every time new code is pushed.
# This isn't an ideal solution. I would prefer a requirements.txt file
# option like --constantly-bleeding-edge that makes pip redownload a
# dependency all the time, but that doesn't exist yet.
